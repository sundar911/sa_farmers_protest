# Sentiment Analysis of the Farmers' Protest

In this short project, I have 
• Scraped 1000 tweets regarding the farmers' protests in India \n
• Cleaned and preprocessed tweets using NLTK in python
• Used textblob fto assign polarity scores to each tweet
• Implemented two models for sentiment classsification: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
• Trained, tested and compared the models based on accuracy

The entire code, data and a detailed report can be found in the repository.
