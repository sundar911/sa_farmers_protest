# Sentiment Analysis of the Farmers' Protest

In this short project, I have: <br />
• scraped 1000 tweets regarding the farmers' protests in India <br />
• cleaned and preprocessed tweets using NLTK in python <br />
• used textblob to assign polarity scores to each tweet <br />
• implemented two models for sentiment classsification: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression <br />
• trained, tested and compared the models based on accuracy <br /> <br />

The entire code, data and a detailed report can be found in the repository.
