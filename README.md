# Sentiment Analysis of the Farmers' Protest

In this short project, I have <br />
• Scraped 1000 tweets regarding the farmers' protests in India <br />
• Cleaned and preprocessed tweets using NLTK in python <br />
• Used textblob fto assign polarity scores to each tweet <br />
• Implemented two models for sentiment classsification: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression <br />
• Trained, tested and compared the models based on accuracy <br /> <br />

The entire code, data and a detailed report can be found in the repository.
